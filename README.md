# Sorting Algorithms

Implementation of some of sorting algorithms done in C, C++ and most of it in C#. Algorithms is the basis to learning programming, so I've made this repository which can help other developers understand how do they work. Feel free to `git clone` and try it yourself!

## Tools:

- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## How to run:

After .NET SDK is installed, you can enter the terminal in any folder and run:

```
cd Bubble_Sort
dotnet run
```
